# Neuronal Dynamics exercises 

Here are my attempts at the python exercises in the book *Neuronal Dynamics* by Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud and Liam Paninski. They are likely to be far away from the perfect answer, but hopefully this will be useful to people who are stuck / looking to confirm their answers.

The exercises are useful as an introduction to simulating biological neural networks, and are available here:
